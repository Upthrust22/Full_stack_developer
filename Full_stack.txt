WHAT IS FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT

A full stack developer is a type of software developer that can perform front end and back end operations plus has a rich 
comprehensive set of programming skills, programming languages and problem solving aptitude. This simply means the 
developer can build the back end and front end of web applications.

Front end development has to do with the user interface of an application, what the users see like buttons, images, text 
and colors etc.

Back end development has to do with implementing the logic behind how the platform works, the work of a backend developer 
cannot be seen with your eyes but you can experience the effect of his code by how well this application works.

Apart from just front and back end, a full stack developer is able to make database queries to manipulate data, he/she also
 tests software and fixes bugs to improve user experience. The developer must have a grasp of programming languages and 
frameworks like html, css, javaScript, React.js, Angular.js, Node.js, Python Django, Java Spring etc.
